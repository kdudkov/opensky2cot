# Opensky to CoT data converter

This simple python script fetches aircraft position data from [Opensky Network](https://opensky-network.org/)
and pushes it to Cursor-on-Target server (like [FreeTakServer](https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/FreeTakServer), or
[Goatak](https://github.com/kdudkov/goatak)). Must work with ATAK server too.
